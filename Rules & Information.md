**Zac's Game Changer Rules:** 

Hello there all! Welcome to the Game Changer's sheet! Here are the rules for the series:

- I start a game hosting an FFA CutClean, Bleeding Sweets, Hastey Boys, Timber game as a start for BOTH EU and NA Servers. 
- NA Game will happen every Saturday at 00:00 UTC (8:00 PM Eastern Time)
- EU Game will happen every Sunday at 17:00 UTC* (01:00 PM Eastern). The Asterisks represents that it may not occur depending on if I have a 5k race day during this time period. 

When a player wins a game and/or gets top kills, they get to choose one of these options for the next game.

- Add Scenarios (Choose up to three scenarios from /scen list)
- Change Teamsize
- Remove Scenarios (Up to how ever many, but they cannot replace the scenarios.)
- Change 2 Config Options
- Change Version (If 1.8 it'll be 1.20, if 1.20 back to 1.8)
- Keep it as it is

- As for the scenarios, if a scenario has been hosted a max of 5* times in a row (Besides CutClean), it will automatically be removed so that way games can become more different than normal.

* This depends on the rating of the scenario based on impact. Low impact scenarios is a max of 5. High impact rating is 3. Admin Scenario is 1. (The admin scenario cannot be hosted back to back same with the high impact the low impact can be there as well to reset its streak) 

If the game is a Team game, the person on the winning team with the most kills will be able to pick from one of these options! If there are more than 2 people on the winning team, both with most kills in the game, the first person to get the most kills will get to pick the option

If the person wins a game, and has the most kills, they will get to pick 2 options.  

The decision will go as follows: The player who wins will pick first, then the person with the most kills will pick next. The top killer will be notified about what the winner has chosen and has the power to change it if they so desire.

**Captains/Auction Rules/Mystery Teams Rules**

- Auction, Captains, and Mystery Team games are teamsize options. 
- Their modes are the scenarios. 
- Auction will be defaulted to Double Packaging 
- Captains mode will be its standard form.
- Mystery Teams will be banner mode. 


**CURRENT SCENARIOS FOR EU GAME:**

- CutClean (Infinite), Bleeding Sweets (5), Hastey Boys (5), Timber (5)

Any Config Differences: None

**CURRENT SCENARIOS FOR NA GAME:**

One last thing in mind, PLEASE BE REASONABLE WITH YOUR DECISIONS! I will reject your addition if it is reasonably unfit/provides a bad experience towards the community! Please think before you choose!

Have a great day and good luck in my games!
