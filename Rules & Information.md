# Zac's Game Changer Rules: 

Hello there all! Welcome to the Game Changer's Series 4: Bounties! Here are you will find all the information regarding the rules of this reformed series! For viewing the config of each respective server click [Here for EU]() and [Here for NA]()

- I start a game hosting an FFA True Vanila game as a start for BOTH EU and NA Servers. 
- NA Game will happen every Saturday at 00:00 UTC (7:00 PM Eastern Time)
- EU Game will happen every Sunday at 17:00 UTC* (12:00 PM Eastern). The Asterisks represents that it may not occur depending on if I have a Race on that day during this time period.
- For contact on discord regarding questions or if you won/top fragged in one of my games my discord IGN is zac083. If you're in the Arctic server, my DMs are open, so no need to friend me, just send the message.

## What is Game Changers?

- Game Changers is a series I created for individuals to change the game to their liking! I always believe listening towards what the community wants is important for a healthy game balance. 
- If you're wondering how to parttake in this, all you have to do to join one of my games! You will get a chance to prove your worth for a chance to change certain settings of my games.
- In order to change the settings of my games, you need to do one of two things. You can either win the game, or you can be the individual with the most kills.
- I am also announcing new featuring to Series 4! Take a look at the next few paragraphs for more information.

## Teamsize Rotation!

  - In order for unique games to be present, we are getting rid of the Change Teamsize Option and replaced it with the Rotation!
  - After each game, the teamsize will switch from an FFA, to cTo2, to cTo3, then cTo4, then back to FFA!
  - You can change the rotation size by either decreasing by one or increasing by 1. (Max is cTo11 then goes to cToX, minimum is To2)

## Bounties!

-  To make the games a little bit more intesne, players that have previously won the game will have a bounty on their heads!
-  At the beginning of the series, I will randomly pick 1 player to have a bounty of a free pick to change my game! In order for the bounty to go away, they must kill 2 players and survive until Meetup!
-  If you have won the game before, you will get a bounty of a free pick and same requirements as stated above!
-  If you win 2 games in a row on the same region, you have a Cash Bounty! You're now wanted with a free pick for my game, but also a bounty of $20 USD on your head. For this bounty to go away, you must kill 5 players and survive until Meetup!
-  If the wanted player did not meet the requirements before Meetup arrives, it will not go away. 
-  If you kill a player with a bounty, you will claim that bounty for yourself!
-  If you kill a player, who did have a bounty but met the requirements stated above, you will get nothing.

## Bounties in a Team Settings!

- If a player has a pick bounty, they will only be wanted as an individual. They must kill 2 players and survive until Meetup as an individual to keep the pick. **YOU CANNOT TEAMKILL/SCUMBALL FOR THE BOUNTY, THEY MUST PLAY IT OUT**
- If the player has a cash bounty with crossing teaming being on, they are wanted as individuals and must kill 5 players alone before Meetup occurs! **YOU CANNOT TEAMKILL/SCUMBALL FOR THE BOUNTY, THEY MUST PLAY IT OUT**
- If the player has a cash bounty and is on a team, with cross teaming being disabled, then everyone on the team will be wanted for that cash bounty. Cash payout will be dependant by how many players are alive at the end.
- For the team, that has a cash bounty, to claim the bounty they must kill 8 players total as a To2, 12 as a team of 3, 16 as a team of 4, 20 as a team of 5 etc. before Meetup occurs!
- Whoever kills the last player on the team, who has a team cash bounty, will earn that payout depending on who is left after that team has been eliminated.

## BOUNTY RULES AND INFORMATION:

- In order to have a bounty, you must have the same IGN or same Nicked IGN. Being on a different IGN will not count, thus unvalidating your streak.
- Sacrificing is NOT PERMITTED. If I do see a sacrifice being committed for the bounty to be claimed for each of their gains, you will both be banned for Sacrificing and no bounty will be claimed.
- Team Killing the player with a bounty will not earn you the bounty whatsoever, it will just be eliminated.
- NA and EU Bounties are serperate! If you win a game on NA then EU, that does not validate a 2 game win streak!

## Winning or Top Fragging the Game

- Congrats on achieving one or both of these feats! You now have the option to change some settings of my games!
- You are allowed to pick one option based if you top fragged or won. You get a second pick if you did achieve both.
- If there is a tie for the most kills, whoever achieve the most kills first will get the pick.

### OPTIONS FOR CHANGING GAME:
  - Add 3 Scenarios
  - Remove 3 Scenarios
  - Scenario Replacement (Choose 1 scenario to remove then add 1 scenario of your own)
  - Permanent Game Scenario (Choose 1 that is currently active to be permnanent for the next future games. THIS CANNOT BE TRUE VANILLA)

  - Undoing either a Pernament Scenario ban or Permanent Game Scenario
  - Changing 4 Config Options
  - Increasing or Decreasing Teamsize Rotation by 1.
  - Change Version to either 1.8 or 1.20.

## Winning or Top Fragging in a Team Setting:

- In a team setting, whoever is left alive at the end will get a pick.
- Whoever has the top frag will get their pick individually.

## Order of Picks!

### The order of picks will goes as follows:
  - First pick goes to winning the game.
  - Second pick goes to top fragging the game.
  - Third pick goes to achieved bounties (Killing the wanted player)
  - Fourth pick goes to evaded bounties (If the wanted player achieved their bounty requirements)


## Last Note:


One last thing in mind, PLEASE BE REASONABLE WITH YOUR DECISIONS! I will reject your addition if it is reasonably unfit/provides a bad experience towards the community! Please think before you choose!

Have a great day and good luck in my games!
From,
Zac083
