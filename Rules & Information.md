- I start a game hosting an FFA True Vanila game as a start for BOTH EU and NA Servers. 
- NA Game will happen every Saturday at 00:00 UTC (7:00 PM Eastern Time)
- EU Game will happen every Sunday at 17:00 UTC* (12:00 PM Eastern). The Asterisks represents that it may not occur depending on if I have a Race on that day during this time period.
- For contact on discord regarding questions or if you won/top fragged in one of my games my discord IGN is zac083. If you're in the Arctic server, my DMs are open. So no need to friend me, just send the message.

## What is Game Changers?

- Game Changers is a series I created for individuals to change the game to their liking! I always believe listening towards what the community wants is important for a healthy game balance. 
- If you're wondering how to parttake in this, all you have to do to join one of my games! You will get a chance to prove your worth for a chance to change certain settings of my games.
- In order to change the settings of my games, you need to do one of two things. You can either win the game, or you can be the individual with the most kills.
- I am also announcing new featuring to Series 4! Take a look at the next few paragraphs for more information.

## Teamsize Rotation!

  - In order for unique games to be present, we are getting rid of the Change Teamsize Option and replaced it with the Rotation!
  - After each game, the teamsize will switch from an FFA, to cTo2, to cTo3, then cTo4, then back to FFA!
  - You can change the rotation size by either decreasing by one or increasing by 1. (Max is cTo11 then goes to cToX, minimum is To2)

## Bounties!

-  To make the games a little bit more intense, players that have previously won the game will have a bounty on their heads!
-  At the beginning of the series, I will randomly pick 1 player to have a bounty of a free pick to change my game! In order for the bounty to go away, they must kill 2 players and survive until Meetup!
-  If you win the game during series 4, you will get a bounty of a free pick and same requirements as stated above!
-  If you win 2 games in a row on the same region, you have a Cash Bounty! You're now wanted with a free pick for my game, but also a bounty of $20 USD on your head. For this bounty to go away, you must kill 5 players and survive until Meetup!
-  If the wanted player did not meet the requirements before Meetup arrives, it will not go away. They must win the game in order to claim their own bounty now!
-  If you kill a player with a bounty, you will claim that bounty for yourself! No one else will be able to claim it.
-  If you kill a player, who did have a bounty but met the requirements stated above, you will get nothing.

## Bounties in a Team Settings!

- If a player has a pick bounty, they will only be wanted as an individual. They must kill 2 players and survive until Meetup as an individual to keep the pick. **YOU CANNOT TEAMKILL/SCUMBALL FOR THE BOUNTY, THEY MUST PLAY IT OUT**
- If the player has a cash bounty with crossing teaming being on, they are wanted as individuals and must kill 5 players alone before Meetup occurs! **YOU CANNOT TEAMKILL/SCUMBALL FOR THE BOUNTY, THEY MUST PLAY IT OUT**
- If the player has a cash bounty and is on a team, with cross teaming being disabled, then everyone on the team will be wanted for that cash bounty. Cash payout will be dependant by how many players are alive at the end.
- For the team, that has a cash bounty, to claim the bounty they must kill 8 players total as a To2, 12 as a team of 3, 16 as a team of 4, 20 as a team of 5 etc. before Meetup occurs!
- Whoever kills the last player on the team, who has a team cash bounty, will earn that payout depending on who is left after that team has been eliminated.

## BOUNTY RULES AND INFORMATION:

- In order to have a bounty, you must have the same IGN or same Nicked IGN. Being on a different IGN will not count, thus unvalidating your streak.
- Sacrificing is NOT PERMITTED. If I do see a sacrifice being committed for the bounty to be claimed for each of their gains, you will both be banned for Sacrificing and the bounty will be voided.
- Team Killing the player with a bounty will not earn you the bounty whatsoever, it will just be voided.
- NA and EU Bounties are serperate! If you win a game on NA then EU, that does not validate a 2 game win streak!

## Winning or Top Fragging the Game

- Congrats on achieving one or all of these feats! You now have the option to change some settings of my games!
- You are allowed to pick one option based if you top fragged or won. You get a second pick if you did achieve both.
- If there is a tie for the most kills, whoever achieve the most kills first will get the pick.
- You have until Wednesday at 23 UTC to claim the pick, if you do not choose by then, your pick you won is voided.

## Last Note:


One last thing in mind, PLEASE BE REASONABLE WITH YOUR DECISIONS! I will reject your addition if it is reasonably unfit/provides a bad experience towards the community! Please think before you choose!

Have a great day and good luck in my games!

Zac083
